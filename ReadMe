I, Shashwat Rohilla (133050009) M.Tech CSE, hereby declare that this is an independent solution.
The submitted work is totally mine. I have not copied any code from any other source.

Run the 'make run' command in the current directory.
It will compile the program, and will run it as ./main.out < input.in > image.ppm and open image.ppm.
Program consumes an input file (eg input.in) and produces a ppm image file.
Please refer to Documentation.html for details.

main.cpp contains the main() function
